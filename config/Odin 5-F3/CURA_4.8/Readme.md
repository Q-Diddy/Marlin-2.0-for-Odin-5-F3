# CURA 4.8 

## Introduction

Since CURA does not have a 'machine export' option, I'm afraid the best I can do is provide a full dump of the settings used for the calibration cat here, and a 3mf file of the calibration cat project.   This file is very complete, with every setting including the start/end GCODE settings.  

Someday, someone will make a proper machine import/export feature for CURA, like exists in all the other slicers.  Until then, sorry for the pain this is.

Basic machine settings are:

* Bed / Machine size : X 235mm, Y 235mm, Z 250mm  and check the "heated bed" box when creating a custom printer.
* Nozzle size is 0.40mm
* Filament size is 1.75mm
