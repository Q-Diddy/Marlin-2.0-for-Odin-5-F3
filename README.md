# Marlin-2.0-for-Odin-5-F3
Tested Marlin 2.0 Source Code for FoKoos Odin 5-F3

FoKoos / Shenzhen Apeman Innovations Co. ( 深圳市元仁创新科技有限公司 ) has released a printer called the Odin 5-F3 which is based on a Robin MKS Nano 1.2 board paired up with a touch TFT35 display.

As the company is just getting started, they are still working on getting GitHub repo with the exact files and firmware deployed on their machines to be GPL compliant.  Since the printer is based on open source firmware, I have taken a bit of time to reverse engineer their configuration and create a valid and compatible firmware that matches the way they have configured their machine from the factory.

In order to respect their US Trademark, I have replaced the boot logo with one from my YouTube channel to differentiate this firmware from the factory original.  In every other aspect it should be equivalent otherwise.
