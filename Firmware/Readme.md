# Installing Firmware

To install this firmware onto your Odin 5-F3 printer you will need to format a microSD card with a FAT32 filesystem.  Copy the files to the top directory of the card appropriate to your machine.  Stock Odin 5-F3 machines need the files in the "manual_level" directory.

Power off the printer, then insert the card.  You will see the printer say something like "TFT Updating" and then it will be followed up by "Erasing Images" and then the assets images will be copied to the display.
